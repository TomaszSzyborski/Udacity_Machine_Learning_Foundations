OR Perceptron
The OR perceptron is very similar to an AND perceptron. In the image below,
the OR perceptron has the same line as the AND perceptron, except the line is shifted down.
What can you do to the weights and/or bias to achieve this? Use the following AND perceptron to create an OR Perceptron.

NOT Perceptron
Unlike the other perceptrons we looked at, the NOT operations only cares about one input.
The operation returns a 0 if the input is 1 and a 1 if it's a 0.
The other inputs to the perceptron are ignored.

In this quiz, you'll set the weights (weight1, weight2)
and bias bias to the values that calculate the NOT operation on the second input and ignores the first input.
