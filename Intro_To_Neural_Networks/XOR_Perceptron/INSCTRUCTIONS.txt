An XOR perceptron is a logic gate that outputs 0 if the inputs are the same and 1 if the inputs are different. Unlike previous perceptrons, this graph isn't linearly separable. To handle more complex problems like this, we can chain perceptrons together.

Let's build a neural network from the AND, NOT, and OR perceptrons to create XOR logic. Let's first go over what a neural network looks like.
